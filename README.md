# AAS Overcooked-AI
This project contains my finished submission for final project of Autonomous and Adaptive Systems (92858), a second-cycle (masters) course in Artifical Intelligence at the University of Bologna that explores RL.
The objective is to implement an RL algorithm on multi-agent environment [Overcooked-AI](https://github.com/HumanCompatibleAI/overcooked_ai) inspired by the video game of the same name [Overcooked](http://www.ghosttowngames.com/overcooked/).
I have chosen to use PPO for this project.

## Setup
Simply run `setup.sh` and follow the provided instructions. The script should create a new virtual environment,
but you must activate it using the given instructions.
Run `performance_tests.ipynb` to understand how the code works and the general performance and results of the implementation.
