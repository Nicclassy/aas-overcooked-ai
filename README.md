# AAS Overcooked-AI
This project contains my yet to be finished submission for final project of Autonomous and Adaptive Systems (92858), a second-cycle (masters) course in Artifical Intelligence at the University of Bologna that explores RL.
The objective is to achieve a mean > 50 on the multi-agent environment [Overcooked-AI](https://github.com/HumanCompatibleAI/overcooked_ai) inspired by the video game of the same name [Overcooked](http://www.ghosttowngames.com/overcooked/). I have chosen to use PPO as my RL algorithm of choice.

This repository will be updated as I make progress.
