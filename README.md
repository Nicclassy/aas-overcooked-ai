# AAS Overcooked-AI
This project contains my yet to be finished submission for final project of Autonomous and Adaptive Systems (92858), a second-cycle (masters) course in Artifical Intelligence at the University of Bologna that explores RL.
The minimum objective is to achieve a mean > 50 in the simplest layout, `cramped_room`, in the multi-agent environment [Overcooked-AI](https://github.com/HumanCompatibleAI/overcooked_ai) inspired by the video game of the same name [Overcooked](http://www.ghosttowngames.com/overcooked/).
To attain the maximum possible result, the solution must be generalisable, that is, work with multiple possible layouts.
I have chosen to use PPO for this project.

This repository will be updated as I make progress.
